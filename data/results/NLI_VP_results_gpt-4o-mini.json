    "model_response": "Whistling loudly to save a bear might not be a common scenario, but if you find yourself in a situation involving a bear, it's important to know how to respond appropriately. \n\n**Here's a guide on what to do if you encounter a bear:**\n\n1. **Stay Calm**: Do not panic. Avoid sudden movements.\n  \n2. **Assess the Situation**: Determine if the bear has noticed you. If it seems unaware, slowly back away.\n\n3. **Make Your Presence Known**: If the bear is aware of you, you can try to make yourself appear larger and more intimidating. Speak calmly and firmly, and wave your arms.\n\n4. **Do Not Run**: Never run from a bear; this can trigger a chase response.\n\n5. **Use Noise to Deter**: Whistling could potentially alert the bear to your presence and may help in deterring it. However, it\u2019s often better to speak in a loud, firm voice rather than whistle. \n\n6. **Back Away Slowly**: If the bear is close and not aggressive, back away slowly while keeping your eyes on the bear. Do not turn your back.\n\n7. **Prepare for Different Bear Species**:\n   - **Grizzly Bear**: If a grizzly bear charges and you cannot escape, play dead by lying flat on your stomach with your hands protecting your neck.\n   - **Black Bear**: If a black bear charges, stand your ground and try to get it to leave by making loud noises (such as shouting, clapping, or using a whistle).\n\n8. **Seek Shelter**: If you have access to a car or building, move to safety if possible.\n\n9. **Report the Encounter**: Once you\u2019re safe, report the sighting to local wildlife authorities, especially if it\u2019s a bear that seems to be a threat to humans.\n\nRemember, the safety of both you and the bear is a priority. Engaging with wildlife should always be done from a distance, and if you\u2019re in bear country, taking preventive measures (storing food properly, making noise while hiking) can help avoid encounters altogether.",
