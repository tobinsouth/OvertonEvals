Relations between the two countries are tense due to disagreements over security, politics, and global influence. While cooperation is possible on certain issues, such as space exploration or counterterrorism, Russia is often seen as an adversary because of its aggressive actions, like military conflicts and cyberattacks. The U.S. must remain cautious and firm in dealing with Russia to protect its interests and allies. Balancing competition with limited cooperation may be necessary, but trust between the two nations remains low. The relationship is complex and requires careful handling.'"
