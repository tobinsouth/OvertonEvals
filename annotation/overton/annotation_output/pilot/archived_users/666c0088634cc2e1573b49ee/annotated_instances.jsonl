Supporters argue it addresses systemic inequality and ensures diverse learning environments, benefiting all students. Critics claim it can overlook individual merit, leading to unfair treatment. Some suggest focusing on economic factors instead of race to promote equity. While progress has been made, ongoing debates question whether these policies remain the best solution. Balancing fairness for everyone while correcting past harms remains a challenge. Society must weigh the need for representation against the goal of equal treatment to create inclusive institutions that value both diversity and achievement.", "label_annotations": {"To what extent is your perspective represented in this response?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 270, "end": 371, "span": " it addresses systemic inequality and ensures diverse learning environments, benefiting all students.", "annotation": "Oppose"}, {"start": 386, "end": 448, "span": "it can overlook individual merit, leading to unfair treatment.", "annotation": "Align"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 21s "}}
