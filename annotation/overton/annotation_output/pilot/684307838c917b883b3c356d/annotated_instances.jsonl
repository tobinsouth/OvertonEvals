Some argue it promotes equality and strengthens national unity. Others believe it encourages illegal immigration and strains resources. Changing this policy would require a constitutional amendment, which is difficult and rare. The debate involves questions of fairness, immigration control, and national identity. While keeping birthright citizenship supports inclusivity, ending it could tighten border policies. The decision would have major effects on society and future generations.

Life in prison is a safer option because it stops violence without risking irreversible errors. Many studies show that this punishment does not actually stop others from committing crimes. In addition, it often costs more than keeping someone in prison for life. Other countries have already ended this practice, and doing the same can build a more just and caring society.

However, critics worry about wait times and limited choices. The private insurance market offers more personal choices but leaves millions uninsured and costs more overall.
