When governments control education, they may limit ideas and creativity. Teachers and experts know best what students need to learn. Freedom in education encourages new discoveries and different viewpoints. However, some basic standards can ensure quality. Too much government control can stop progress and discourage critical thinking. Trusting educators leads to better learning and prepares students for the future. A balance between independence and guidelines works best. Schools should have the freedom to teach while meeting broad educational goals.

It might also address unfairness in education costs, as many struggle despite working hard. However, others argue that loans are personal responsibilities, and canceling debt could reward poor planning or unfair to those who already paid theirs. Taxpayers might also end up covering the cost. The debate centers on fairness, economic impact, and personal accountability.
