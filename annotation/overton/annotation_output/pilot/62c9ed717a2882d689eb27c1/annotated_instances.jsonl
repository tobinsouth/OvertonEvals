Retaining it can serve as a deterrent to crime, but it also risks executing innocent people. Abolishing it would ensure no innocent lives are lost, but it may lead to increased crime rates. Many argue that life imprisonment is a more humane and effective alternative, allowing for rehabilitation and reflection. Ultimately, the decision depends on balancing justice, morality, and the value of human life. A thorough examination of the evidence and ethical considerations is necessary to make an informed decision.

Life in prison is a safer option because it stops violence without risking irreversible errors. Many studies show that this punishment does not actually stop others from committing crimes.

Courts can be biased, affecting poor and minority groups unfairly. Life imprisonment without parole can punish serious criminals and protect society without taking a life.
