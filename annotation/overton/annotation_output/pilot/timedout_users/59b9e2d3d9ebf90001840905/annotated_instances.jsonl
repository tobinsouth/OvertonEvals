Supporters argue it protects free speech, letting organizations share views. Critics claim it lets wealth sway voters, undermining fairness. Allowing unlimited funds could give corporations outsized influence, while restrictions might limit expression. The Court must balance these concerns, weighing democratic integrity against free speech rights. Future decisions will impact election fairness and free speech. Striking this balance is key to ensuring elections represent the public's voice without silencing groups.
