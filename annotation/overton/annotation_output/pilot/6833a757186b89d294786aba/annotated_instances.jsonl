The two countries have many disagreements on important global issues, including politics, security, and military actions. Their relationship is marked by distrust and competition rather than cooperation. While there are moments of diplomacy, ongoing conflicts and opposing interests mean they do not work closely together. Experts and leaders in both nations often view each other as rivals instead of partners.
