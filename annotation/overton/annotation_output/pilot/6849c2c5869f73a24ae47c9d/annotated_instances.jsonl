Life in prison is a safer option because it stops violence without risking irreversible errors. Many studies show that this punishment does not actually stop others from committing crimes. In addition, it often costs more than keeping someone in prison for life. Other countries have already ended this practice, and doing the same can build a more just and caring society.
